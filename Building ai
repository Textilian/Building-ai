*Building AI Project*

*Overview*

This project aims to design and develop an intelligent personal assistant AI that can perform various tasks, such as scheduling appointments, sending emails, and making recommendations.

*Features*

- *Conversational AI Interface*: Engage in natural language conversations with the AI assistant.
- *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*: Utilize NLP techniques for intent recognition and entity extraction.
- *Machine Learning Algorithms*: Leverage machine learning for personalized recommendations and decision-making.
- *Knowledge Graph*: Store and retrieve user information and preferences using a knowledge graph.

*Technologies Used*

- *Python*: Primary programming language for the project.
- *TensorFlow*: Utilized for building and training machine learning models.
- *PyTorch*: Used for natural language processing and deep learning tasks.
- *NLTK*: Employed for natural language processing and text analysis.
- *spaCy*: Used for advanced natural language processing tasks.
- *Scikit-learn*: Utilized for machine learning and data analysis.
